# upkit
A Pythonic ROOT-style analysis, plotting, and fitting library for nuclear and particle physics.  

**upkit** provides general-purpose tools for histogramming, plotting, and fitting data, designed to be flexible, robust, and easy to use for physics analyses.

---

## Features
- ROOT-like histogramming and plotting with `matplotlib`
- General-purpose fitting using `scipy` and `iminuit`
- Fit quality metrics (χ², reduced χ², AIC)
- High-energy physics friendly: integrates with `uproot`, `awkward`, and `vector`
- Optimized performance with `numba`
